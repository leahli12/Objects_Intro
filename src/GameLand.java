//Game Example
//Lockwood Version 2023-24
// Learning goals:
// make an object class to go with this main class
// the object class should have a printInfo()
//input picture for background
//input picture for object and paint the object on the screen at a given point
//create move method for the object, and use it
// create a wrapping move method and a bouncing move method
//create a second object class
//give objects rectangles
//start interactions/collisions
